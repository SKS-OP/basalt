# Basalt

**Basalt** is a stdlib-first Go toolkit for building REST APIs with minimal boilerplate.

It focuses on:

- Using Go’s standard library (`net/http`, `context`) as the foundation  
- Built-in support for JWT and PIN-based authentication flows  
- Generic CRUD controllers for any `IDataSource` implementation  
- First-class support for PostgreSQL and MySQL  
- Rich query layer with filters and **dig** (related data loading)  
- Minimal dependencies, clear interfaces  

Basalt is **not a web framework** — it’s a toolkit that plugs into whatever routing solution you prefer.
